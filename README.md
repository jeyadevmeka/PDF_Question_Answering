# PDF_Question_Answering
This project is a backend service for PDF-based question-answering. Users can upload PDFs, then ask questions via WebSocket to get real-time answers based on the documentâ€™s content. Built with FastAPI, PyMuPDF, and NLP models, it includes Redis-based rate limiting for efficient handling of requests, making it ideal for interactive document analysis
